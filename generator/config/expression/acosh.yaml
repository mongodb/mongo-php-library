    Returns the inverse hyperbolic cosine (hyperbolic arc cosine) of a value in radians.

        description: |
            $acosh takes any valid expression that resolves to a number between 1 and +Infinity, e.g. 1 <= value <= +Infinity.
            $acosh returns values in radians. Use $radiansToDegrees operator to convert the output value from radians to degrees.
            By default $acosh returns values as a double. $acosh can also return values as a 128-bit decimal as long as the expression resolves to a 128-bit decimal value.
