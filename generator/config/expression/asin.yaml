        description: |
            $asin takes any valid expression that resolves to a number between -1 and 1, e.g. -1 <= value <= 1.
            $asin returns values in radians. Use $radiansToDegrees operator to convert the output value from radians to degrees.
            By default $asin returns values as a double. $asin can also return values as a 128-bit decimal as long as the expression resolves to a 128-bit decimal value.
