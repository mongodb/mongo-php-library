Dependencies
------------

To get started using in-use encryption in your project, the
`PHP driver <https://php.net/mongodb>`_ (i.e. ``mongodb`` extension) will need
to be compiled with `libmongocrypt <https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt>`_
(enabled by default).

Additionally, either `crypt_shared`_ or `mongocryptd`_ are required in order to
use *automatic* client-side encryption. Neither is required for *explicit*
encryption.


crypt_shared
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :manual:`Automatic Encryption Shared Library </core/queryable-encryption/reference/shared-library/>`
(crypt_shared) provides the same functionality as mongocryptd_, but does not
require you to spawn another process to perform automatic encryption.

By default, the PHP driver attempts to load crypt_shared from the system path(s)
and uses it automatically if found. To load crypt_shared from another location,
use the ``cryptSharedLibPath`` auto encryption
:php:`driver option <manual/en/mongodb-driver-manager.construct.php#mongodb-driver-manager.construct-driveroptions>`
when constructing a client. If the driver cannot load crypt_shared it will
attempt to fallback to using mongocryptd by default. The
``cryptSharedLibRequired`` option may be used to always require crypt_shared and
fail if it cannot be loaded.

For detailed installation instructions see the MongoDB documentation for the
:manual:`Automatic Encryption Shared Library </core/queryable-encryption/reference/shared-library/>`.


mongocryptd
~~~~~~~~~~~

The mongocryptd binary is an alternative requirement for automatic client-side
encryption and is included as a component in the
:manual:`MongoDB Enterprise Server package </administration/install-enterprise/>`.
For detailed installation instructions see the
:manual:`MongoDB documentation on mongocryptd </core/csfle/reference/mongocryptd/>`.

mongocryptd performs the following:

- Parses the automatic encryption rules specified in the client configuration.
  If the ``schemaMap`` auto encryption driver option contains invalid syntax,
  mongocryptd returns an error.

- Uses the specified automatic encryption rules to mark fields in read and write
  operations for encryption.

- Rejects read/write operations that may return unexpected or incorrect results
  when applied to an encrypted field. For supported and unsupported operations,
  see :manual:`Supported Operations for Automatic Encryption </core/csfle/reference/supported-operations/>`.

A client configured with auto encryption will automatically spawn the
mongocryptd process from the application's ``PATH``. Applications can control
the spawning behavior via various auto encryption
:php:`driver options <manual/en/mongodb-driver-manager.construct.php#mongodb-driver-manager.construct-driveroptions>`.

mongocryptd is only responsible for supporting automatic client-side encryption
and does not itself perform any encryption or decryption.


Managing Encryption Keys
------------------------

.. seealso:: :manual:`Encryption Key Management </core/csfle/fundamentals/manage-keys/>` in the MongoDB manual

Creating an Encryption Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   The following examples use a local master key. While this is suitable for
   development, a production application should use a supported cloud provider
   (e.g. AWS KMS). The master key is used to encrypt locally stored data keys
   and thus it is very important that you keep this key secure.

To create an encryption key, create a
:php:`MongoDB\\Driver\\ClientEncryption <class.mongodb-driver-clientencryption>`
instance with encryption options and create a new data key. The method will
return the key ID which can be used to reference the key later. You can also
pass multiple alternate names for this key and reference the key by these names
instead of the key ID. Creating a new data encryption key would typically be
done on initial deployment, but depending on your use case you may want to use
more than one encryption key or create them dynamically.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/create_data_key.php
   :language: php


Referencing Encryption Keys by an Alternative Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While it is possible to create an encryption key every time data is encrypted,
this is not the recommended approach. Instead, you should create your encryption
keys depending on your use case, e.g. by creating a user-specific encryption
key. To reference keys in your software, you can use the ``keyAltName``
attribute specified when creating the key. The following example creates an
encryption key with an alternative name, which could be done when deploying the
application. The script then encrypts data by referencing the key by its
alternative name.

To use an alternate name when referencing an encryption key, use the
``keyAltName`` option instead of ``keyId``.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/key_alt_name.php
   :language: php


Client-Side Field Level Encryption
----------------------------------

Introduced in MongoDB 4.2,
:manual:`Client-Side Field Level Encryption </core/csfle/>` allows an
application to encrypt specific data fields in addition to pre-existing MongoDB
encryption features such as
:manual:`Encryption at Rest </core/security-encryption-at-rest/>` and
:manual:`TLS/SSL (Transport Encryption) </core/security-transport-encryption/>`.

With field level encryption, applications can encrypt fields in documents prior
to transmitting data over the wire to the server. Client-side field level
encryption supports workloads where applications must guarantee that
unauthorized parties, including server administrators, cannot read the encrypted
data.


Automatic Client-Side Field Level Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   Automatic client-side field level encryption requires MongoDB 4.2+ Enterprise
   or a MongoDB 4.2+ Atlas cluster.

Automatic client-side field level encryption is enabled by creating a client and
specifying the ``autoEncryption``
:php:`driver option <manual/en/mongodb-driver-manager.construct.php#mongodb-driver-manager.construct-driveroptions>`.
The following examples demonstrate how to setup automatic client-side field
level encryption and use a
:php:`MongoDB\\Driver\\ClientEncryption <class.mongodb-driver-clientencryption>`
object to create a new encryption key.


Providing Local Automatic Encryption Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following example uses the ``schemaMap`` auto encryption driver option to
define encrypted fields using a
:manual:`strict subset of the JSON schema syntax </core/csfle/fundamentals/create-schema/>`.

Specifying a ``schemaMap`` this way provides more security than relying on JSON
schemas obtained from the server. It protects against a malicious server
advertising a false JSON schema, which could trick the client into sending
unencrypted data that should be encrypted.

JSON schemas specified in the ``schemaMap`` auto encryption driver option only
apply to configuring automatic client-side field level encryption. Other
validation rules in the JSON schema will not be enforced by the driver and will
result in an error.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/csfle-automatic_encryption-local_schema.php
   :language: php


Server-Side Field Level Encryption Enforcement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The MongoDB 4.2+ server supports using schema validation to enforce encryption
of specific fields in a collection. This schema validation will prevent an
application from inserting unencrypted values for any fields marked with the
:manual:`"encrypt" JSON schema keyword </core/csfle/reference/encryption-schemas/>`.

The following example sets up a collection with automatic encryption using a
``$jsonSchema`` validator and
:manual:`Encryption Schema syntax </core/csfle/fundamentals/create-schema/>`.
Data in the ``encryptedField`` field is automatically encrypted on insertion and
decrypted when reading on the client side.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/csfle-automatic_encryption-server_side_schema.php
   :language: php


Explicit Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Explicit encryption is a MongoDB community feature and does not use
crypt_shared_ or mongocryptd_. Explicit encryption is provided by the
:php:`MongoDB\\Driver\\ClientEncryption <mongodb-driver-clientencryption>` class.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/csfle-explicit_encryption.php
   :language: php


Explicit Encryption with Automatic Decryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although automatic encryption requires MongoDB 4.2+ enterprise or a MongoDB 4.2+
Atlas cluster, automatic *decryption* is supported for all users. To configure
automatic decryption without automatic encryption set the
``bypassAutoEncryption`` auto encryption
:php:`driver option <manual/en/mongodb-driver-manager.construct.php#mongodb-driver-manager.construct-driveroptions>`
when constructing a client.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/csfle-explicit_encryption_automatic_decryption.php
   :language: php


Queryable Encryption
--------------------

Introduced in MongoDB 7.0,
:manual:`Queryable Encryption </core/queryable-encryption/>` is another
form of in-use encryption. Data is encrypted client-side. Queryable Encryption
supports indexed encrypted fields, which are further processed server-side.


Automatic Queryable Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   Automatic queryable encryption requires MongoDB 7.0+ Enterprise or a MongoDB
   7.0+ Atlas cluster.

Automatic encryption in Queryable Encryption utilizes ``crypt_shared`` or
``mongocryptd`` to automatically encrypt and decrypt data client-side. The data
in the ``encryptedIndexed`` and ``encryptedUnindexed`` fields will be
automatically encrypted on insertion and decrypted when querying on the client
side. Additionally, it is possible to query on the ``encryptedIndexed`` field.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/queryable_encryption-automatic.php
   :language: php


Explicit Queryable Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   Explicit queryable encryption requires MongoDB 7.0+.

Explicit encryption in Queryable Encryption is performed using the
:php:`MongoDB\Driver\ClientEncryption::encrypt() <mongodb-driver-clientencryption.encrypt>`
and :php:`decrypt() <mongodb-driver-clientencryption.decrypt>` methods. Although
values must be explicitly encrypted (e.g. insertions, query criteria), automatic
decryption for queries is possible by configuring ``encryptedFields`` on the
collection, as demonstrated in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/queryable_encryption-explicit.php
   :language: php
