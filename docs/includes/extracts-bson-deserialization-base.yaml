ref: _bson-deserialization
content: |
  .. note::

      {{method}} does not yet support a ``typeMap`` option for BSON
      deserialization of the returned document.

      Classes implementing
      :php:`MongoDB\\BSON\\Persistable <class.mongodb-bson-persistable>`
      are deserialized according to the :php:`persistance
      <mongodb.persistance>` specification.
