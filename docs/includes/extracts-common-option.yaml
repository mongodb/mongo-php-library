ref: common-option-codec
content: |
  The :doc:`codec </tutorial/codecs>` to use for encoding or decoding documents.
  This option is mutually exclusive with the ``typeMap`` option.
---
ref: common-option-collation
content: |
  :manual:`Collation </reference/collation>` allows users to specify
  language-specific rules for string comparison, such as rules for lettercase
  and accent marks. When specifying collation, the ``locale`` field is
  mandatory; all other collation fields are optional. For descriptions of the
  fields, see :manual:`Collation Document </reference/collation/#collation-document>`.
---
ref: common-option-comment
content: |
  Enables users to specify an arbitrary comment to help trace the operation
  through the :manual:`database profiler </reference/database-profiler>`,
  :manual:`currentOp </reference/command/currentOp>` output, and
  :manual:`logs </reference/log-messages>`.
---
ref: common-option-comment-string-before-4.4
content: |
  The comment can be any valid BSON type since MongoDB 4.4. Earlier server
  versions only support string values.
---
ref: common-option-hint
content: |
  The index to use. Specify either the index name as a string or the index key
  pattern as a document. If specified, then the query system will only consider
  plans using the hinted index.
---
ref: common-option-let
content: |
  Map of parameter names and values. Values must be constant or closed
  expressions that do not reference document fields. Parameters can then be
  accessed as variables in an aggregate expression context (e.g. ``$$var``).

  This is not supported for server versions prior to 5.0 and will result in an
  exception at execution time if used.
---
ref: common-option-maxTimeMS
content: |
  The cumulative time limit in milliseconds for processing operations on the
  cursor. MongoDB aborts the operation at the earliest following
  :term:`interrupt point`.

  Defaults to the {{object}}'s read concern.
replacement:
  object: object
---
ref: common-option-readConcern-transaction
content: |
  It is not possible to specify a read concern for individual operations as part
  of a transaction. Instead, set the ``readConcern`` option when
  :php:`starting the transaction <mongodb-driver-session.starttransaction>`.
---
ref: common-option-readPreference
content: |
  :manual:`Read preference </reference/read-preference>` to use for the
