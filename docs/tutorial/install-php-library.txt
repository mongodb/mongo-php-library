=========================
Install the |php-library|
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Prerequisites
-------------

The MongoDB PHP Library is a high-level abstraction for the
MongoDB PHP driver. As such, you must install the `mongodb`
extension to use the |php-library|:

.. code-block:: sh

   pecl install mongodb
   echo "extension=mongodb.so" >> `php --ini | grep "Loaded Configuration" | sed -e "s|.*:\s*||"`

Instructions for installing the `mongodb` extension on HHVM may be
found in the :php:`Installation with HHVM
<mongodb.installation.hhvm>` article
in the driver documentation.

Procedure
---------

Install the Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The preferred method of installing |php-library| is with `Composer
<https://getcomposer.org/>`_ by running the following from your project
root:

.. code-block:: sh

   composer require mongodb/mongodb

While not recommended, you may also manually install the package via
the source tarballs attached to the `GitHub releases
<https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-library/releases>`_.

Configure Autoloading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have installed the library, ensure that your application
includes Composer's autoloader. The ``require_once``
statement should point to Composer's autoloader, as in the following example:

.. code-block:: php

   require_once __DIR__ . "/vendor/autoload.php";

Refer to Composer's `autoloading documentation
<https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading>`_ for more
information about setting up autoloading.

If you installed the library manually from a source tarball, you
will also need to manually configure autoloading:

#. Map the top-level ``MongoDB\`` namespace to the ``src/`` directory
   using your preferred autoloader implementation.

#. Manually require the ``src/functions.php`` file, since PHP does not
   yet support function autoloading.
