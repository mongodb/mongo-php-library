            $cos takes any valid expression that resolves to a number. If the expression returns a value in degrees, use the $degreesToRadians operator to convert the result to radians.
            By default $cos returns values as a double. $cos can also return values as a 128-bit decimal as long as the <expression> resolves to a 128-bit decimal value.
