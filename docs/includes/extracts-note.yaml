ref: note-bson-comparison
content: |
  When evaluating query criteria, MongoDB compares types and values according to
  its own :manual:`comparison rules for BSON types
  </reference/bson-type-comparison-order>`, which differs from PHP's
  :php:`comparison <manual/en/types.comparisons.php>` and :php:`type juggling
  <manual/en/language.types.type-juggling.php>` rules. When matching a special
  BSON type the query criteria should use the respective :php:`BSON class
  <manual/en/book.bson.php>` in the extension (e.g. use
  :php:`MongoDB\BSON\ObjectId <class.mongodb-bson-objectid>` to match an
  :manual:`ObjectId </reference/object-id/>`).

  This command can only be run on a deployment hosted on
  `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/>`__ and requires an Atlas cluster tier of at
  least M10. A
  `Local Atlas Deployment <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/cli/stable/atlas-cli-deploy-local/#use-atlas-search-with-a-local-atlas-deployment>`__
  can also be used for development.

ref: note-atlas-search-async
content: |
  Atlas Search indexes are managed asynchronously. After creating or updating an
  index, you can periodically execute
  :phpmethod:`MongoDB\Collection::listSearchIndexes()` and check the
  ``queryable`` :manual:`output field  </reference/operator/aggregation/listSearchIndexes/#output>`
  to determine whether it is ready to be used.
