            $tan takes any valid expression that resolves to a number. If the expression returns a value in degrees, use the $degreesToRadians operator to convert the result to radians.
            By default $tan returns values as a double. $tan can also return values as a 128-bit decimal as long as the expression resolves to a 128-bit decimal value.
