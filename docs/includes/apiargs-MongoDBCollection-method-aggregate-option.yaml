arg_name: option
name: allowDiskUse
type: boolean
description: |
  Enables writing to temporary files. When set to ``true``, aggregation stages
  can write data to the ``_tmp`` sub-directory in the ``dbPath`` directory. The
  default is ``false``.

arg_name: option
name: batchSize
type: integer
description: |
  Specifies the initial batch size for the cursor. A batchSize of ``0`` means an
  empty first batch and is useful for quickly returning a cursor or failure
  message without doing significant server-side work.

  .. note::

     This is not supported for inline aggregation results (i.e. ``useCursor``
     option is ``false`` or the server version is < 2.6).

  This only applies when using the :ref:`$out <agg-out>` stage.

  Document validation requires MongoDB 3.2 or later: if you are using an earlier
  version of MongoDB, this option will be ignored.

arg_name: option
name: useCursor
type: boolean
description: |
  Indicates whether the command will request that the server provide results
  using a cursor. The default is ``true``.

  For MongoDB version 2.6 or later, ``useCursor`` allows users to turn off
  cursors if necessary to aid in replica set or shard cluster upgrades.

  ``useCursor`` is ignored for MongoDB versions prior to 2.6 as aggregation
  cursors are not available.

post: |
  This only applies when the :ref:`$out <agg-out>` stage is specified.

  This is not supported for server versions prior to 3.4 and will result in an
  exception at execution time if used.
