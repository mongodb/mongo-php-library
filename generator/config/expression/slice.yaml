    Returns a subset of an array.
arguments:
    -
        name: expression
        type:
            - resolvesToArray
        description: |
            Any valid expression as long as it resolves to an array.

        name: position
        type:
            - resolvesToInt
        optional: true
        description: |
            Any valid expression as long as it resolves to an integer.
            If positive, $slice determines the starting position from the start of the array. If position is greater than the number of elements, the $slice returns an empty array.
            If negative, $slice determines the starting position from the end of the array. If the absolute value of the <position> is greater than the number of elements, the starting position is the start of the array.

        name: "n"
        type:
            - resolvesToInt
        description: |
            Any valid expression as long as it resolves to an integer. If position is specified, n must resolve to a positive integer.
            If positive, $slice returns up to the first n elements in the array. If the position is specified, $slice returns the first n elements starting from the position.
            If negative, $slice returns up to the last n elements in the array. n cannot resolve to a negative number if <position> is specified.
